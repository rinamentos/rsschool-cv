### About myself:
While working in Scan Revolution, which is my current job right now, I have been in contact with people who are working in the IT industry.
They really inspired me to start reading about programming and to go deeper into this topic. So I took up a course "Web Developing" on Udemy to understand the basics. 
Meanwhile, I also started to learn HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript on W3Schools, in order to broaden my knowledge even more. 
Currently, I am using these sources to feed myself with the new information or with the information that I do not know yet. 


At the moment, I am studying the full course on Rolling Scopes School on JavaScript/Front End basics. 
This was a serious step of me in order to start reaching my goal - become a Frontend Developer. 
Since, I am the person who learns really quick and who does everything possible to reach the goal, I believe that I will succeed in this.
Unfortunately, I do not have any experience in Web Developing, except the small tasks which I have done during the courses. 
However, I always courage knowledge and I am constantly working on self-developing, because I do not like to stay at one point and feel like I do not make any progress for 
myself.
